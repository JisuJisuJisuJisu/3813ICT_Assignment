# S5310537

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.1. The system enables real-time communication between users across various groups and channels, offering both text and video chat functionalities. It supports creating and managing multiple communication channels, ensuring smooth interaction within different user groups.

## Project Structure

The structure of the project directory is as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the project, including Angular components.
- `public/`: Stores static files such as background images and other assets.
- `server/`: Holds backend server files and logic.
- `server/uploads`: Directory where files uploaded by users are stored on the server.
- `src/app/`: Contains Angular components responsible for the frontend functionality.

## Git Branch Structure

My Git repository for this project is organized into several branches to maintain my progress throughout the project duration and clearly indicate the current stage I am at. Having completed Phase 1, the structure for the branches related to Phase 2 is as follows:

- **Main Branch**: This branch is merged when all functionalities from the separate branches are working correctly and without errors, maintaining a stable version of the project. It always contains reliable code, indicating that the project is ready for deployment.
  
- **feature/peerjs**: This branch was created to integrate PeerJS for implementing video call functionality. By utilizing PeerJS, it allows for real-time video and audio communication between users.
  
- **feature/socket**: This branch focuses on adding the chat functionality using Socket.IO, enabling real-time communication. Through Socket.IO, users can instantly send and receive messages, creating an interactive environment.
  
- **feature/fixerrors**: This branch is dedicated to fixing numerous server and client errors that arose during the migration to MongoDB. It aimed to resolve bugs and issues discovered during the transition process, enhancing the overall stability of the application.
  
- **feature/mongodb**: This branch deals with the stage of migrating data to use MongoDB in Phase 2. The goal is to transform and transfer data according to MongoDB's schema, improving the efficiency of data management.

### 2.10 Data Relationships
- Each user can belong to multiple groups, and each group contains multiple channels.
- When a user joins a group, the group ID is added to the user’s group list, and the user’s ID is added to the group’s member list.
- Channels are associated with groups, and channel-related logic requires searching for the group before locating the channel.
- When data is deleted or updated, the relationship between users and groups is maintained (e.g., removing a user from a group also updates both user and group records).
- Additionally, since channels are also part of a group, the channel list is updated when a new group is created, and when a channel is created, the group's channel list is also updated.
- This Angular project manages data both in MongoDB and as JSON files on the server. This setup allows regular users to view group members through JSON files, while Super Admin and Group Admin can manage all data comprehensively via MongoDB.
  
## 3. Responsibilities between Client and Server

### 3.1 Client Responsibilities
- **User Interface (UI)**: The client uses Angular to build the UI, allowing users to access features such as login, chat screens, group management, and profile screens.
- **API Calls**: The client sends requests to the server’s REST API and displays the necessary data on the screen based on the server's responses.
- **User Input Handling**: The client processes user inputs (e.g., login forms, group join requests, creating new groups) and sends these requests to the server for processing.

### 3.2 Server Responsibilities
- **REST API**: The server provides various API endpoints to handle client requests, processing data and returning results in JSON format.
  - **Examples**:
    - `GET /groups`: Returns all group information in JSON format.
    - `POST /users`: Registers a new user and returns a success message in JSON format.
- **Serving Static Files**: The server handles and serves static files such as images uploaded by users, enabling the client to display user-generated content.
  - **Example**: `app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads')));` serves uploaded images.
-	**JSON File Updates**: The server updates the users.json and groups.json files along with MongoDB. These files are used for storing and referencing data locally, and the server synchronizes them to maintain the latest information whenever changes occur to users or groups. Through this, regular users can view group and user information via JSON files, while Super Admin and Group Admin can manage the data more comprehensively through MongoDB.
- **Database Interaction**: The server is connected to MongoDB and handles CRUD operations for user, group, channel, and message data based on client requests.
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: The server uses Socket.IO to manage real-time communication with the client, enabling features like instant chat.

- **ChannelComponent**: Handles the display and interaction within a specific channel.

### 5.2 Services

#### 5.2.1 GroupService
Handles group-related tasks such as creating, retrieving, and managing groups.

  - **Function**: Sends a POST request to create a new group.
  - **API Endpoint**: `/groups`
  - **Returns**: Observable of the server's response with the created group.
- **getAllGroups()**:
  - **Function**: Sends a GET request to retrieve all groups.
  - **API Endpoint**: `/groups`
  - **Returns**: Observable containing a list of all groups.
- **getGroupById(groupId: string)**:
  - **Function**: Sends a GET request to fetch a group by its ID.
  - **API Endpoint**: `/groups/{groupId}`
  - **Returns**: Observable containing the group's detailed information.

#### 5.2.2 UserService
Manages user-related tasks such as login, registration, and user data retrieval.
- **login(email: string, password: string)**:
  - **Function**: Sends a POST request to authenticate a user.
  - **API Endpoint**: `/login`
  - **Returns**: Observable with the user’s information upon successful login.
- **signup(newUser: any)**:
  - **Function**: Sends a POST request to register a new user.

### 5.3 Models
The application utilizes three main models:
- **User Model**: Manages user details including name, email, password, roles, and associated groups.
- **Group Model**: Represents a collection of users and channels, including pending users awaiting approval.
- **Channel Model**: Defines subgroups within a group, used for focused discussions or activities.
Refer to **2. Data Structures** for detailed information.

### 5.4 Routes
The application’s routes are structured with the **DashboardComponent** as the central framework. From the dashboard, users can access various components based on their roles (Super Admin, Group Admin, or User). The dashboard provides navigation to group lists, group details, profiles, and group joining functionality, with each user role having access to different components and features.

## 6. Details of the Interaction between Client and Server

### 6.1 Create Group
- **Client Request**: The user submits a group creation form via the `ManageGroupsComponent`, which sends a POST request to `/groups` with the group name, description, and creator ID.
- **Server Processing**:
  - Deletes the `_id` field from the request (MongoDB auto-generates it).
  - Initializes default fields like `pendingUsers` and `members`.
  - Saves the group in MongoDB and updates the creator's group list.
- **Client Response**: The server returns the created group's details, and the UI updates to display the new group.

### 6.2 Handling User Interest Group Requests
- **Client Request**: The user sends a join request via the `JoinGroupComponent` by submitting a POST request to `/groups/:groupId/join` with the user's email and group ID.
- **Server Processing**:
  - Retrieves the group by ID.
